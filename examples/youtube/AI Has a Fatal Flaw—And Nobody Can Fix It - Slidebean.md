## Introduction
AI is advancing at a breakneck pace, but what if there's a **mathematical wall** that limits how smart it can ever get? In this video, we break down the **fundamental equation** that might spell the end of AI's rapid evolution. We’ll explore why even the most powerful models, trained on trillions of parameters with mind-blowing amounts of data, may have already hit a plateau. The hype has been all about making AI smarter—but what if the data just isn’t there?

From GPUs burning through billions of dollars to the surprising limitations of large language models, we’ll dive deep into why AI struggles with reasoning, creativity, and real-world problem-solving. But it’s not over yet—new breakthroughs might find a way around this roadblock. Is AI truly capped, or is there another paradigm shift on the horizon? Let’s find out.

## The Most Expensive Math Equation
> Take a look at this line. This is a hundred million dollar line, probably the most expensive math equation in history. It's a limit, an imaginary wall of physics and mathematics of how intelligent artificial intelligence can ever be.

- This limit is something that even the top scientists have not been able to overcome.
- The clues about this wall have already started to show up, and this equation might put an end to all the bubbly behavior around AI.

## Current AI Capabilities
For years, we've been imagining an artificial intelligence that outsmarts us. However, we should recognize:

- Computers excel at playing games.
- They outsmart us at solving mathematical problems.
- They're more effective at storing data and reciting it back.

Nevertheless, that isn’t true intelligence.

## Current AI Models and Their Limitations
1. **AI Models**:
    - Current AI companies differentiate between current AI and **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**.
    - Even with hands, can a GPT actually cook an egg for breakfast? 

2. **The AI Buzz**:
    - The valuation of companies like NVIDIA is based on:
        - The need for smarter models requiring all those GPUs.
        - An increase in daily AI adoption.
        - The expectation that AI models will exponentially improve.
        
3. **Competition**: 
   - Some Chinese startups have developed AI models touted to rival OpenAI's capabilities, achieving significant downloads and challenging big tech.

## Understanding AI Model Training
To grasp why the aforementioned math equation poses a threat, we need to understand how current models are trained.

- GPT's main function is predicting the next word in a sentence.
- This skill allows models to outperform humans on many standardized tests.
  
### Parameters in AI Models
- The number of **parameters** is crucial.
    - Example: GPT has **175 billion parameters**, enabling it to function effectively.
  
### Tokenization and Embedding
1. **Tokenization**: 
    - Pre-trained transformers break sentences into tokens (smaller pieces of words).
  
2. **Embedding**: 
    - Words are classified in a **12,288-dimensional space** to understand meaning. 
    - Similar words cluster together in this high-dimensional space.
    
## The Math Behind AI's Functionality
- The mapping of words into a multi-dimensional space is called **embedding**. 
- The model transforms words based on context to better understand meaning.

### Transformation Layer
- Transformers adjust word positions to derive specific meanings from context. 

### Neural Network Adjustments
- The model learns from trial and error through billions of operations and training data, refining its predictions.

## Limitations and the Plateau
- Despite scaling models with more data, the **diminishing returns** become evident.
  
1. **Wall of Diminishing Returns**:
    - More data and bigger models yield only marginal improvements in capabilities.
  
2. **Data Limitations**:
    - There's an insufficient amount of training data to satisfy AI models' needs for perfection. 

## Current State of AI Technology
- The transformer model is significant in scientific breakthroughs, leading to advancements in diverse fields, including predicting protein shapes.

## Possible Future Breakthroughs
- There are potential breakthroughs based on the efficiency of new models like **DeepSeq**, which might achieve similar results with fewer parameters and costs.

## Integrating Other Systems
- Companies are trying to connect rational reasoning capabilities using similar transformer models.
  
1. **Steps in Reasoning**:
    - The new method involves breaking down problems into smaller components, allowing AI to provide better responses.
  
2. **Chain of Thought**:
    - This iterative thinking process enables AI to excel in various human intelligence tests. 

## Conclusion
- While AI models perform impressively in controlled scenarios, they still struggle with common sense reasoning and creativity in real-world applications.
- The ongoing evolution of AI raises questions about the eventual blending of AI with practical tasks.
